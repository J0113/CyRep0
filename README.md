# CyRep0 Repository Generator and Manger for Cydia
Repository Generator and Manager for Cydia written in Python.
NOTE: This program is currently in Beta. There may be issues, please create an issues [here](https://github.com/J0113/CyRep0/issues "issues")

## How to use?

#### Any Platform

Make sure that Python 3.7 has been installed on your system. Than make sure to install bz2 and easygui. 

Download the source code and start CyRep0.py. (During setup of a new repo all files in the repo are needed, after creation CyRep0.py can work standalone!)


#### Windows

For Windows, you may use the any platform methode or you can use the .exe! The exe is much easier to use, the exe is compiled with py2exe so it should be reversable if anyone really wants to check the code.

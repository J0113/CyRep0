CyRep0 is an free to use, open source repo manager designed for Cydia. CyRep0 is fully written in Python 3 (.7).

Cydia's Packages System is bassed on Debian's APT repository. It's almost the same so in theorie CyRep0 should be compatile with that aswell (Maybe with some modifications). 

CyRep0 has been written by J0113 and is avalible on Github ( J0113.github.io/CyRep0 )! Please report any issue's there!

It's build on Windows, it should work on Mac OS X and any Linux system. Make sure to install Python 3.7 and EasyGUI and BZ2 have been installed! (On windows use the EXE, everything is in there!)
